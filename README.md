## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Feature Extraction (`feature_extraction.py`)

The system automatically extracts the following medical features from patient reports:

#### Extracted Features:
- **Diagnosis**: Primary disease condition
- **Stage**: Disease staging (e.g., Stage I, II, III, IV)
- **Mutations**: Genetic mutations (EGFR, STK11, T790M, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, HER2, CD20)
- **ECOG Score**: Performance status (0-4 scale)
- **Comorbidities**: Existing conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis, COPD, TB, asthma)
- **Medications**: Current medications (metformin, insulin, aspirin, statin, prednisone, rituximab, CHOP)
- **Lab Values**: Laboratory test results (ALT, AST, creatinine, HbA1c, WBC, hemoglobin)

#### Extraction Methods:
- **Regular Expression Patterns**: Pattern-based text extraction
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Robust matching regardless of text case
- **Flexible Format Support**: Handles various text formats and structures

### 2. Trial Data Management (`trial_data.py`)

#### Synthetic Trial Generation:
- **30 Clinical Trials**: Automatically generated for demonstration
- **Diverse Conditions**: Covers lung cancer, lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer
- **Multiple Mutations**: EGFR, ALK, KRAS, CD20 mutations
- **Variable Criteria**: Different ECOG requirements and exclusion criteria

#### Trial Structure:
```python
{
    "id": "trial_001",
    "name": "Synthetic Trial 1",
    "inclusion": {
        "diagnosis": "Non-small cell lung cancer",
        "mutation": "EGFR",
        "ecog_max": 1
    },
    "exclusion": {
        "comorbidities": ["hepatitis", "TB"]
    },
    "criteria_text": "Detailed eligibility criteria text"
}
```

### 3. Structured Matching (`structured_matching.py`)

#### Rule-Based Eligibility Assessment:
- **Inclusion Criteria Matching**: Checks diagnosis, mutations, and ECOG scores
- **Exclusion Criteria Checking**: Identifies disqualifying comorbidities
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides specific reasons for eligibility/ineligibility

#### Matching Logic:
1. **Diagnosis Match**: Verifies patient diagnosis against trial requirements
2. **Mutation Check**: Confirms presence of required genetic mutations
3. **ECOG Validation**: Ensures performance status meets trial limits
4. **Comorbidity Screening**: Checks for exclusionary conditions

### 4. Semantic Matching (Dual Approach)

#### Standard Semantic Matching (`semantic_matching.py`):
- **Sentence Transformers**: Uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model for text embedding
- **Scikit-learn Integration**: Cosine similarity for efficient matching
- **Deployment-Safe**: Works reliably on all platforms including Streamlit Cloud

#### Advanced Semantic Matching (`semantic_matching_advanced.py`):
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Vector database for enhanced semantic search
- **Rich Metadata**: Stores additional trial information with embeddings
- **Advanced Features**: Better similarity algorithms and metadata filtering
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatically switches to standard mode if ChromaDB unavailable

#### Semantic Analysis Process:
1. **Text Embedding**: Convert patient report and trial criteria to vectors
2. **Vector Processing**: Store and query embeddings efficiently
3. **Similarity Search**: Find most similar trials using cosine distance
4. **Ranking**: Return top matches with similarity scores

### 5. Advanced Web Application (`app.py`)
